<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-h:3f17bf03-4c47-4410-abf8-1db4a0ac7775">
<p>
This is the second major version of Denote, close to one year after
its initial release.  The video demo I did back then remains relevant,
even though lots of details have changed.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-h:a3a9e14d-4132-47c0-a23c-cb008a141668" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="h:a3a9e14d-4132-47c0-a23c-cb008a141668"><a href="#h:a3a9e14d-4132-47c0-a23c-cb008a141668">Notes have a new optional SIGNATURE field</a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:a3a9e14d-4132-47c0-a23c-cb008a141668">
<p>
It is now possible to create notes that include a <code>SIGNATURE</code> field in
their file name.  Either use the convenience command <code>denote-signature</code>
or configure the user option <code>denote-prompts</code> to affect what the <code>denote</code>
command should prompt for.
</p>

<p>
Signatures are arbitrary strings of characters that enable the user to
further qualify their documents.  One possible workflow is to write
relational notes, such that <code>1a1</code> is the first extension of another
note with a <code>1a</code> signature.
</p>

<p>
The design of the <code>SIGNATURE</code> field is consistent with the Denote
file-naming scheme.  The field separator is the double equals sign
(<code>==</code>), while words that comprise the signature are joined together by
a single equals sign.  As such, the user can prefix a search with an
equals sign to match words in the <code>SIGNATURE</code>, just as they would use
dashes for the <code>TITLE</code> and underscores for the <code>KEYWORDS</code>.
</p>

<p>
[ Read the manual for the technicalities of the Denote file-naming
  scheme.  This is not limited to "notes": any file can be named
  accordingly (I do it with my videos, for example). ]
</p>

<p>
Signatures are not included in a file's front matter.  This is a
strategic decision to preserve backward compatibility, while not
introducing a feature that has not enjoyed widespread usage.  I want
to make signatures behave the same as the rest of the file name
fields, though I am interested to learn how users employ them in their
workflow.
</p>

<p>
The signature extension was discussed at length on the GitHub mirror
in issue 115: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/115">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/115</a>.
Thanks to Stefan Thesing, Mirko Hernandez, Noboru Ota (nobiot),
Xiaoxing Hu, nbehrnd, Elias Storms, and 101scholar for helping me
reason about this feature, understand its scope, and prototype its
implementation.
</p>

<p>
Also thanks to Alfredo Borrás and Jeremy Friesen for discussing with
me the field delimiter of signatures on the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C2A597B4E-5F18-4D97-9457-B3C859DAA020%40zoho.eu%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C2A597B4E-5F18-4D97-9457-B3C859DAA020%40zoho.eu%3E</a>.
Thanks to Kai von Fintel for doing the same on the GitHub mirror in
issue 147: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/147">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/147</a>.
</p>

<p>
Read the original announcement:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-03-20-emacs-denote-signature-feature/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-03-20-emacs-denote-signature-feature/</a>.
</p>

<p>
As part of the development, I fixed a case where
<code>denote-rename-file-using-front-matter</code> would fail if it could not
find a signature
</p>

<p>
The idea is that we want the command to behave the way it always did
when the file has no signature and to preserve the signature when it
is present.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to relict for reporting the issue on the mailing list:

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:d24645a3-ad02-450c-b3d7-af7802aa0b26">
<p>
Denote provides commands to rename an existing file to one that
follows the Denote file-naming scheme (videos, PDFs, other text
documents, &#x2026;).  Check, for example, the <code>denote-rename-file</code> and
<code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files</code>.  The idea is to make everything
easier to search.
</p>

<p>
In prior versions, these commands could produce duplicate identifiers
if the modification date of the underlying files was the same.  Such a
scenario occurs when the files are modified programmatically, as with
the <code>touch</code> command or the various <code>git</code> operations.
</p>

<p>
Denote will now take care to increment the identifier until it becomes
unique within the current scope.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Felipe Balbi for reporting this bug in issue 105 on the
GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/105">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/105</a>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-h:6ea998be-83dd-4c67-945c-11011372818f">
<p>
The <code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files</code> now accepts two optional
arguments.  When called interactively, these are interpreted as a
single or double universal prefix argument (<code>C-u</code> by default, though
do <code>M-x where-is</code> and search for <code>universal-argument</code>).
</p>

<p>
The first argument, named <code>SKIP-FRONT-MATTER-PROMPT</code>, skips the "yes
or no" prompt requested at the outset of the operation, passing to it
an affirmative response.  Thanks to Jay Rajput for asking the question
that inspired me to implement this.  It was done in issue 155 on the
GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/155">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/155</a>.
</p>

<p>
The second argument, named <code>NO-UNIQUE-ID-CHECK</code>, will not perform any
checks for potential duplicate identifiers.  The default is to check
for duplicates and increment them such that they become unique.  The
reason this optional argument exists is for those who want to speed up
the process, perhaps because they know ahead of time all identifiers
will be unique or do not care about them.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Bruno Boal for refining how the prefix argument is
processed.  The patch was sent via a private channel.  The change is
small and thus does not require copyright assignment to the Free
Software Foundation.

<p>
Users of <code>menu-bar-mode</code> and/or <code>context-menu-mode</code> will now find a
submenu with points of entry to Denote.  Refer to the publication I
made on my website, as it includes a picture:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-03-31-emacs-denote-menu/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-03-31-emacs-denote-menu/</a>.  I
will save the thousand words for the following sections. 🙃
</p>

<p>
There is a known issue where the <code>menu-bar-mode</code> entry is positioned
before the <code>File</code> submenu.  Apparently, there exists an inelegant way
to place the menu elsewhere, but I am not willing to maintain hacks
for missing functionality.  If someone knows a clear way to put the
submenu elsewhere, please contact me: I want it to be after <code>Tools</code>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Kai von Fintel and Noboru Ota (nobiot) for discussing the
placement of the submenu:

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:acf95a79-3c45-423d-a88f-d6eed7fa5387">
<p>
Originally, Denote was organised as a collection of several files,
each of which had its own prefix like <code>denote-dired.el</code>, and
<code>denote-link.el</code>.  This arrangement was deemed surplus to requirements
and all core code was consolidated in <code>denote.el</code>.  An artefact of
that design was the presence of symbols that retained their admittedly
awkward names, like the command <code>denote-link-backlinks</code> or
<code>denote-link-add-missing-links</code>.
</p>

<p>
All such commands are deprecated.  They are replaced with more
discoverable names.  The deprecation is done in such a way that the
old names are aliases for the new ones, but the user is warned not to
rely on them.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:98f6b10a-ea29-49d1-8d3f-e2f0409f4c8f">
<p>
The Denote file-naming scheme is designed to be a low-tech way of
embedding information in files, making them easier to find.  A
downside is that the names are longer than <code>blah.txt</code> and so the
default Emacs behaviour is to derive a buffer name from the file name.
</p>

<p>
The new optional <code>denote-rename-buffer.el</code> provides a minor mode to
automatically rename the buffer of an existing file, such that it
reflects the file's <code>TITLE</code> field.  Users must enable
<code>denote-rename-buffer-mode</code>.
</p>

<p>
The renaming procedure is controlled by the user option
<code>denote-rename-buffer-function</code>.  By default, it provides the means to
rename using (i) the title, (ii) the identifier, or (iii) a custom
function that returns a string.  Experienced users can refer to
<code>denote-rename-buffer-with-title</code> to draw inspiration on the design of
such a function.
</p>

<p>

implement this feature.  The discussion took place in issue 151 on the

<p>
Denote provides a feature to isolate files in to their own silos, each
of which functions as its own <code>denote-directory</code> variable.  The
technicalities are explained in the manual.  Silos have proven to be a
valuable aspect of file management and I have thus expanded their
scope to work as fully fledged directory trees.  This means that we no
longer assume a silo to be a flat directory listing, but instead
recognise any subdirectories inside of it.

<p>
The idea is to have short keywords and then use more than one, if
necessary.  We do not want to encourage the habit of long keywords
that become overly specific, while we want to avoid the use of
dashes as delimited in the file name's <code>KEYWORDS</code> field.
</p>

<p>
Technically, this changes the default value of the user option
<code>denote-allow-multi-word-keywords</code>.  Users who preferred the old
behaviour can simply toggle it on.

Denote is not an extension of Org mode, though it can integrate with
<code>org-capture</code>.  I now make it possible to design a capture template
that uses specific prompts.  Consult the section in the manual titled
"Create note with specific prompts using Org capture".

Denote can leverage the Org feature of "dynamic blocks" to produce
lists of links/backlinks.  This is especially useful for metanotes

was always able to create <code>denote:</code> Org link types to, for example,
<code>jpg</code> files but <code>denote-get-path-by-id</code> was refusing to resolve the
otherwise valid path.  Thanks to user relict007 for reporting the
problem and discussing it with me in issue 135 on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/135">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/135</a>.
</p>

<p>
The change was not trivial.  It was followed up by a patch from Noboru
Ota (nobiot) which elaborated on the conditionality.  Quoting from
commit <code>9ce9a24</code>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
fix(denote-get-path-by-id): #135
</p>

<p>
Reference: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/135">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/135</a>
</p>

<p>
This patch change function 'denote-get-path-by-id' to allow for the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A single ID points to multiple files with different extensions</li>
<li>Denote needs to find a single file out of the multiple files</li>
<li>This is not necessarily a user error (export an Org file to an HTML)</li>
<li>Denote should let user decide their "primary" file extension</li>
</ul>

<p>
The case the patch is intended to fix goes something like this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You have 20230216__mynotes&#x2013;tag.org.</li>
<li>You export it to 20230216__mynotes&#x2013;tag.html.</li>
<li>Both files are in denote-directory</li>
<li>This means you have two files with the same ID with different
extensions denote-link-find-file, denote-link-find-backlink, and xref
integration might find the html file INSTEAD OF the .org file</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is because html is earlier in the alphabetical order than
org. Because the function uses seq-find, it will find the .html file
first and returns it.
</p>

<p>
Denote implements minibuffer histories for all its relevant functions.
This makes it easier for users to retrieve their previous inputs and
to not get irrelevant ones.
</p>

<p>
Before, the <code>denote-title-prompt</code> was not using its own history but
was instead relying on another one that was intended only for file
paths, thus mixing unrelated inputs.

<li>Revised <code>denote-link-return-{links,backlinks}</code> to not produce a
<code>user-error</code>.  The errors are reserved for the interactive
functions. The others are for developers. Thanks to Elias Storms for
bringing this matter to my attention:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/commit/694c1517be73949edbc3993c105c764da8e2571f#commitcomment-112677876">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/commit/694c1517be73949edbc3993c105c764da8e2571f#commitcomment-112677876</a>.</li>

<li>Refrained from trying to find forward links in non-text-files.  If a
file extension is not in <code>denote-file-types</code>, we have no way of
parsing or finding outgoing links in it. This change checks for the
file extension early on in 'when-let*' block and avoids opening the
file which is a relatively costly operation (and would fail finding
links anyway).  Thanks to relict007 for the patch.  This was done on
the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87r0riffdx.fsf%40kotlak.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87r0riffdx.fsf%40kotlak.com%3E</a>
The change is small and thus does not require copyright assignment
to the Free Software Foundation.</li>

<li>Explained how to troubleshoot Denote.  Refer to the section in the
manual titled "Troubleshoot Denote in a pristine environment."
While this is about Denote, the skills apply to all Emacs packages.</li>

<li>Ensured backlinks get correct <code>denote-directory</code> path.  The
backlinks buffer will now get the correct path when it is generated
inside a silo.  This is related to issue 129 reported by hapst3r on
the GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/129">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/129</a>.
The change is necessary because <code>.dir-locals.el</code> do not work for
buffers, so we must get the value from the file that calls
<code>denote-link-backlinks</code>.</li>

<li>Added missing underscore from examples in exporting section.  Thanks
to Peter Prevos for bringing this matter to my attention:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87fs8b85tq.fsf%40prevos.net%3E#%3C87lehiuxfo.fsf@protesilaos.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87fs8b85tq.fsf%40prevos.net%3E#%3C87lehiuxfo.fsf@protesilaos.com%3E</a>.</li>

<li>Made the command <code>denote-open-or-create</code> work with an empty
<code>denote-directory</code>.  The <code>denote-file-prompt</code> would throw an error
before.  The correct behaviour is to proceed to the "Create" phase
if the <code>denote-directory</code> is empty.  Thanks to user drcxd for
reporting the bug in issue 131 on the GitHub mirror and for testing
my sample code: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/131">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/131</a>.</li>

<li>Documented how to use tree-based file prompt on demand.  This is my
solution to a request made by Mirko Hernandez on the possible use of
the old Denote file prompt.  It is better not to introduce a user
option for this case, nor to keep multiple variants of the
<code>denote-file-prompt</code> in denote.el, as we want to keep things simple.
Mirko's feedback was provided in issue 121 on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/121">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/121</a>.</li>

<li>Added the variable <code>denote-user-enforced-denote-directory</code>.  This is
intended for users who write custom code to extend Denote.  The
value of this variable should be <code>let</code> bound around calls to the
function <code>denote-directory</code>, thus overriding its return value.  This
was discussed on the mailing list and then introduced by Vedang
Manerikar in commit <code>977c757</code>, with further changes by me in
<code>20ddc97</code>: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/41776">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/41776</a>.
Vedang has assigned copyright to the Free Software Foundation.</li>

<li><p>
Fixed <code>my-denote-org-extract-subtree</code> section of the documentation.
This is part of some sample code that is not part of <code>denote.el</code>,
but we provide as a convenience/inspiration for interested parties.
</p>

<p>
The provided function did not work correctly.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Tags are extracted before deleting the region from the source file.</li>
<li>The function <code>org-end-of-subtree</code> is called to calculate the
point we should delete up to.  The previously used function
<code>org-entry-end-position</code> ends at the first sub-heading under the
tree, which is not what we want.  Instead, we want to cut the
whole subtree.</li>
<li>The date information available in the subtree is retained.  We
look for three common places for this information: the <code>CREATED</code>
or <code>DATE</code> properties in the <code>PROPERTIES</code> drawer, and the <code>CLOSED</code>
cookie at the element level itself.</li>

<li>Removed the dependency on the built-in <code>xdg</code> library and updated the
default value of the user option <code>denote-directory</code>.  The reason is
that XDG is a Linux standard that does not work on other operating
systems, according to private feedback I received.</li>

<li><p>
Fixed a regression for <code>M-p</code> (<code>previous-history-element</code>) in "do or
create" commands.  Read the doc string of the commands
<code>denote-open-or-create</code> or <code>denote-link-or-create</code> for how this is
supposed to work.  In short:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Invoke the "do or create" command.</li>
<li>Type something that does not match a file.</li>
<li>In the following title prompt, hit <code>M-p</code> to bring back the last input.</li>
</ul>

<p>

GitHub mirror, which was created by user "ustcpxy":
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/152">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/152</a>.  The issue is
about skipping the file title prompt.
</p></li>

<li>Simplified the internal <code>denote--buffer-file-names</code>.  Thanks to Adam
Růžička for noting that my change was not compatible with older
Emacs versions, and for preparing the change.  This was discussed in
pull request 158 on the GitHub mirror, with my suggestion to not use
<code>seq-filter</code> as it affected the return value:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/158">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/158</a>. The change is
below the 15 line limit, meaning that Adam does have to assign
copyright to the Free Software Foundation.</li>

<li>Documented custom code in the manual on how to interactively select
a silo.  I am providing this in response to a request from GitHub
user rbenit68.  The discussion took place in issue 127 on the GitHub
mirror, with the participation of Mirko Hernandez:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/127">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/127</a>. The custom code
I provide is the expanded version of an idea put forth by Mirko, to
whom I am thankful.</li>

<li>Fixed an outdated reference in the <code>denote-file-types</code> doc string.

<p>
With the help of Noboru Ota (nobiot), we realised that Denote was
broken on Emacs 27 for quite a while.  The fact that we received no
feedback about it suggests that this change is the best course of
action going forward.  Discussion:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C86r0yvzm12.fsf%40nobiot.com%3E#%3C86sfja78ik.fsf@nobiot.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C86r0yvzm12.fsf%40nobiot.com%3E#%3C86sfja78ik.fsf@nobiot.com%3E</a>
</p>

<p>
Emacs 27 lacks certain Xref facilities that we need for the
backlinking facility.  It was holding us back for no good reason,
while also adding to the maintenance burden.
</p>

<p>
If you are using Denote on Emacs 27 and things are working for you,
there is no need to update the package.  Do it when you also upgrade
Emacs to a newer version.

By default, the generic backlinks' buffer, which can be displayed with
the command <code>denote-link-backlinks</code> (alias <code>denote-link-show-backlinks-buffer</code>),
only shows the file names of the linked notes.
</p>

<p>
We have made it possible to produce a more informative view by showing
the context of the link and also listing all links per file.  This is
done by setting the user option <code>denote-backlinks-show-context</code> to a
non-nil value.
</p>

<p>
To illustrate the difference, this is the default backlinks' buffer:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org3891275">

<p>
And this is the one with <code>denote-backlinks-show-context</code> enabled:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org5a0ea51">

Denote now includes the <code>denote-org-dblock</code> library.  Activate it
thus:

<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
A dynamic block gets its contents by evaluating a given function,
depending on the type of block.  The type of block and its parameters
are stated in the opening <code>#+BEGIN</code> line of the block.  Typing <code>C-c
C-c</code> with point on that line runs the function, with the given
arguments, and populates the block's contents accordingly.
</p>

<p>
What Denote has is ways to write blocks that produce a list of links
matching a given regular expression while conforming with some other
parameters.  The manual explains how to use this powerful feature
(which is necessarily specific to the Org file type):
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:8b542c50-dcc9-4bca-8037-a36599b22779">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:8b542c50-dcc9-4bca-8037-a36599b22779</a>.

<p>
Denote was already using Xref internally but has now gained more
capabilities which help it find files more effectively.  With the help
of Emacs' standard project library, all file-related prompts (e.g. to
add a link) search all items in the <code>denote-directory</code> regardless of
whether the user is in a subdirectory or not.
</p>

<p>
All Denote commands benefit from this refactoring.  One such request
to "Make <code>denote-open-or-create</code> work better across subfolders" was
made in issue 114 on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/114">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/114</a>.

Thanks to Noboru Ota (nobiot) for introducing this feature together
with a new system of "modules" for incorporating additional built-in
functionality:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C86a64ooxyi.fsf%40nobiot.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C86a64ooxyi.fsf%40nobiot.com%3E</a></li>

</ul>

<p>
I will not document the new user option <code>denote-modules</code> right now as
my ongoing job search prevented me from exploring the full potential
of this feature.  I promise to do it for the next version of Denote
and update the manual accordingly.  Nevertheless, the doc string of
<code>denote-modules</code> already provides all one needs to get started.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:5a003d44-7ad0-4c92-b908-ec7cf016b2dd">
<p>
The commands <code>denote-open-or-create</code>, <code>denote-link-or-create</code> first
prompt for an existing note.  If they find it, they act on it,
otherwise they prompt for the creation of a new note to operate on.
</p>

<p>
At the first prompt, it is common to use regular expressions and
out-of-order pattern matching (such as with the <code>orderless</code> package),
so the input can be something like <code>_test ^2022 some title</code>, which we
obviously don't want to automatically reuse as the new note's actual
title.
</p>

<p>
To this end, and to accommodate all workflows, we leverage Emacs'
minibuffer history to make the last input accessible with <code>M-p</code> at the
minibuffer prompt (<code>M-x previous-history-element</code>).  The text is
available for further editing before it is submitted as the new note's
title.  Simple, effective, and flexible!

<p>
Denote provides the user option <code>denote-file-type</code> which specifies the
file type to use for new notes.  Options include Org mode (the
default), Markdown+YAML, Markdown+TOML, and plain text.  Furthermore,
there exists the convenience command <code>denote-type</code> (alias
<code>denote-create-note-using-type</code>) which prompts for a file type to use
when creating a new note (I normally write in plain text, but
sometimes switch to Org or Markdown).
</p>

<p>
The variable <code>denote-file-types</code> (which is NOT a user option)
specifies all the parameters of what a "file type" means, such as how
to format its front matter, what style of date+time to use, which file
type extension to write, how to rename the file, what style of link to
apply, and so on.  Advanced users can now edit this variable to either
register new file types or redefine the behaviour of existing ones.
Read this comprehensive guide on how to do it:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-10-30-demo-denote-custom-file-type/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-10-30-demo-denote-custom-file-type/</a>.
</p>

<p>
I repeat: this is for advanced users or, anyhow, for those who are
prepared to maintain some custom code in their setup.  The guide is
accessible though and I am always willing to help anyone in need of
assistance.

<p>
The <code>denote-file-types</code> were introduced by Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay in
pull request 89 at the GitHub mirror and were part of Denote version
0.6.0: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/89">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/89</a>.  I have made
lots of changes since then to make all parts of Denote work with it

The user option <code>denote-excluded-directories-regexp</code> instructs all
Denote functions that read or check file/directory names to omit
directories that match the given regular expression.  The regexp needs
to match only the name of the directory, not its full path.
</p>

<p>
Affected operations include file prompts and functions that return the
available files in the <code>denote-directory</code>.  File prompts are used by
several commands, such as <code>denote-link</code> and <code>denote-subdirectory</code>.
Functions that check for files include <code>denote-directory-files</code> and
<code>denote-directory-subdirectories</code>.

Peter Prevos has produced the <code>citar-denote</code> package which makes it
possible to write notes on BibTeX entries with the help of the <code>citar</code>
package.  These notes have the citation's unique key associated with
them in the file's front matter.  They also get a configurable keyword
in their file name, making it easy to find them in Dired and/or
retrieve them with the various Denote methods.
</p>

<p>
With <code>citar-denote</code>, the user leverages standard minibuffer completion
mechanisms (e.g. with the help of the <code>vertico</code> and <code>embark</code> packages)
to manage bibliographic notes and access those notes with ease.  The
package's documentation covers the details: <a href="https://github.com/pprevos/citar-denote/">https://github.com/pprevos/citar-denote/</a>.

The <code>denote-link-add-missing-links</code> is a companion to what we
already provide to produce a list of links to Denote files matching
a regular expression (the <code>denote-link-add-links</code>).  This new
command adds links that are not already present in the current file.
So if you have a metanote that references, say, your journal entries
but have not updated it in a month, you can revisit the metanote,
invoke <code>denote-link-add-missing-links</code>, and then type the search
terms (e.g. <code>_journal</code>) to include what remains.

The <code>denote-link-find-backlink</code> provides a minibuffer interface that
shows all backlinks to the current note.  It complements the
existing <code>denote-link-backlinks</code> command (which also has the alias
<code>denote-link-show-backlinks-buffer</code>).  Each command has its own
niche: the minibuffer lets the user leverage powerful pattern
matching styles, such as those provided by the <code>orderless</code> package,
while the bespoke buffer provides an easy overview of what links to
the current note.

<li><p>
The <code>denote-keywords-add</code> and <code>denote-keywords-remove</code> are two
commands that interactively operate on the current note's front
matter to add or remove keywords.  They use the familiar keywords'
prompt which means, among others, that they can read more than one
keyword at a time.  To specify multiple keywords, separate each
input with a comma (or whatever the value of <code>crm-separator</code> is,
which should be a comma unless something out-of-the-ordinary is in
force).

The renaming operations are now aware of the underlying version
control system and will use the appropriate command when a VCS is
available.  In practice, renaming a file under, say, Git will
register it as a "rename" instead of two separate actions of
deletion and addition.

Thanks to Florian for the patch.  It was discussed on the mailing
list and then underwent some changes:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C166547153518.8.941129310186454444.68125516@aboulafia.org%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C166547153518.8.941129310186454444.68125516@aboulafia.org%3E</a>.
</p></li>

<li>The <code>denote-rename-file-using-front-matter</code> no longer fails to carry
out its intended task when the front matter has no keywords.  If no
keywords are available, this is interpreted as a request to remove
the KEYWORDS component of the file name.  This was always
technically possible and could be achieved with various permutations
of the user option <code>denote-prompts</code> (as explained in its doc string
or the manual).  Denote only needs an identifier in the file name to
establish unique links (although I strongly encourage you to stick
to the standard file-naming scheme as it is informative, reliable,
and can work even if you access your data without Emacs).</li>

The variable <code>denote-file-types</code> has been tweaked to respond
directly to changes in its value done with <code>setq</code>.  Thanks to Noboru

<li>The <code>:front-matter</code> property of the <code>denote-file-types</code> now accepts
a nil value.  Denote could always work without front matter, but
this was not implemented flexibly in the <code>denote-file-types</code>.
Thanks to Noboru Ota (nobiot) for pointing this out on the mailing
list: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C86k05gsqsg.fsf%40nobiot.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C86k05gsqsg.fsf%40nobiot.com%3E</a>.</li>

<li>The <code>denote-file-prompt</code> function now reads an optional
<code>INITIAL-TEXT</code> argument.  This is a string that prepopulates the
minibuffer.  It is useful for custom commands the user may have
where, for example, there is a need to automatically filter to
entries matching <code>_journal</code>.  Thanks to Alan Schmitt for suggesting
the idea: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87pmf676n1.fsf@m4x.org%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87pmf676n1.fsf@m4x.org%3E</a>.</li>

<li>The <code>denote-rename-file-using-front-matter</code> accepts an optional
<code>AUTO-CONFIRM</code> argument.  It can either be passed interactively or
via Lisp.  The doc string (or the manual) explains the details.
Thanks to Elias Storms for the initial patch:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3Cm2a667aeku.fsf%40gmail.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3Cm2a667aeku.fsf%40gmail.com%3E</a>.</li>

<li>The <code>denote-prompt-for-date-return-id</code> function uses the familiar
<code>denote-date-prompt</code> and returns the appropriate identifier.  It is
used internally by some of our function, but we also provide it for
anyone who wants to write their own custom code.</li>

<li>The <code>denote-retrieve-or-create-file-identifier</code> function reads and
option <code>DATE</code> argument to its mandatory <code>FILE</code> argument.  If <code>FILE</code>
does not have an identifier and optional <code>DATE</code> is non-nil, the
function invokes the <code>denote-prompt-for-date-return-id</code>, as
mentioned above.</li>

<li><p>
The <code>denote-rename-file</code> command accepts an optional <code>DATE</code>
argument.  It functionally does what is described right above, with
the exception that this is for an interactive function (a
"command").  Read the detailed doc string or the manual for
everything that pertains to this powerful command.

<li>The <code>denote-directory-text-only-files</code> function filters the
<code>denote-directory-files</code> to only return a list of text files.  This
leaves out, say, mp3 files.  The function is used internally, though
it may also prove useful in custom user code.</li>

<li>Implemented a <code>revert-buffer-function</code> for the backlinks' buffer,
which is produced by the command <code>denote-link-backlinks</code>.  This
revert function is what the <code>g</code> key invokes with the default key
bindings (the command is <code>revert-buffer</code>).  It produces the buffer
anew, updating the list of backlinks accordingly.</li>

<li><p>
Documented how to speed up the creation of the backlinks' buffer.
As this depends on the built-in <code>xref</code> library, the change is done
by specifying the value of the user option <code>xref-search-program</code> in
Emacs 28 or higher.  For example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">setq</span> xref-search-program 'ripgrep)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
For something more elaborate:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="org-comment">Prefer ripgrep, then ugrep, and fall back to regular grep.
</span>(<span class="org-keyword">setq</span> xref-search-program
      (<span class="org-keyword">cond</span>
       ((<span class="org-keyword">or</span> (executable-find <span class="org-string">"ripgrep"</span>)

       (t
        'grep)))
</pre>
</div></li>

<li>Removed some minor duplication of effort in how the buttonisation of
links is done (what makes them clickable).</li>

<li>Made refinements to the definition of functions such as
<code>denote-link-add-links</code>.  There should be no noticeable change for
users, though this shows we care about code quality.</li>

<li>With Eshel Yaron, we tried to remove the empty indices for functions
and variables from the HTML version of the manual.  These indices
are useful in the Info version, which can be accessed directly from
Emacs when the <code>denote</code> package is installed (for example, evaluate
<code>(info "(denote) Top")</code>), but they do not work with HTML.  Alas,
what we tried to do did not work.  Maybe Org has a way to control
what is exported where.  We shall see.  At any rate, thanks to Eshel
for the effort: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/36028">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/36028</a>.</li>

<li>All code that integrates the <code>denote:</code> custom hyperlink type with
Org's link facility is now assigned <code>autoload</code> cookies.  These are
done to ensure that <code>denote</code> is loaded and is available in cases
where Org needs to access a <code>denote:</code> link at some early stage
(e.g. at startup before using Denote).  Thanks to Sven Seebeck for
reporting the problem: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87r0zovwix.fsf%40svenseebeck.me%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87r0zovwix.fsf%40svenseebeck.me%3E</a>.
Although Sven could not reproduce a bug reliably, I believe this
prevents such an eventuality.</li>

<li>Expanded or otherwise updated the manual to account for all of the
above, where appropriate.</li>

The custom Org hyperlink type of <code>denote:</code> can be visited from
outside the <code>denote-directory</code>.  We now provide the necessary glue
code that Org needs to store these <code>denote:</code> links.  Storing them
can be done with an <code>org-capture</code> template or via the command
<code>org-store-link</code>.  Use this to, for example, capture a TODO that
references one of your notes.
</p>

<p>
<code>denote:</code> links work for as long as the referenced file is somewhere
in the <code>denote-directory</code> or one of its subdirectories.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Marc Fargas for the contribution.  Marc did not need to
assign copyright to the Free Software Foundation, as the patch was
within the ~15 line limit that is permissible.
</p>

<p>
The contribution was discussed on the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/35137">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/35137</a>.  A prior
exchange took place in issue 104 over at the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/104">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/104</a>.
</p>

<p>
Some further tweaks were made to the relevant function.  Thanks to
Elias Storms for reporting on the mailing list a bug which revealed
a regression I introduced to the Org link storing mechanism:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C15D55F4B-64D1-4083-AD5E-B5BACA8F1909%40ap.be%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C15D55F4B-64D1-4083-AD5E-B5BACA8F1909%40ap.be%3E</a>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Following from above, the command <code>denote-link-find-file</code> finds
files reliably, regardless of where the link is stored.  All it
needs is for the target file to be inside the <code>denote-directory</code>.
</p>

<p>
I discovered this while exchanging views with Marc Fargas regarding
the aforementioned patch: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/35137">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/35137</a>.
</p></li>

<li>The command <code>denote-link-buttonize-buffer</code>, which "buttonizes"
<code>denote:</code> links in plain text and Markdown files, now performs its
task regardless of where the current file is stored.  Those links
work for as long as the file they reference is somewhere inside the
<code>denote-directory</code>.</li>

<li><p>
The commands <code>denote-link-after-creating</code>, <code>denote-link-or-create</code>
provide a convenience for users who need to create link to notes
that may not exist yet.  The idea is that one is expounding on a
given topic and wants to create a link to a relevant issue.  They
are not sure if they have written anything about it yet, so they
invoke the relevant command.  Consult their doc strings or read the
manual: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:9e41e7df-2aac-4835-94c5-659b6111e6de">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:9e41e7df-2aac-4835-94c5-659b6111e6de</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to user sienic for suggesting the idea and for testing the
prototypes.  And thanks to Juanjo Presa for participating in the
discussion to share the view that this functionality should be part of
denote.el.  This happened in issue 96 over at the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/96">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/96</a>.
</p></li>

<li>The command <code>denote-open-or-create</code> offers the convenience of
visiting a file, if it exists, else prompting for its creation.
Thanks to Alan Schmitt for the contribution.  The patch was sent on
the mailing list: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87fsgvddny.fsf%40protesilaos.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87fsgvddny.fsf%40protesilaos.com%3E</a>.
It is within the limit of what is allowed without assigning
copyright to the Free Software Foundation, though Alan has done the
relevant paperwork.</li>

<li>The manual expands on two sections: (1) Variants of
<code>denote-open-or-create</code>, (2) Variants of <code>denote-link-or-create</code>.
They show how one can use the above "do or create" commands with
different permutations of the Denote prompts for new note creation.</li>

<li><p>
The manual includes a section titled "Create a note with the
region's contents".  Quote:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Sometimes it makes sense to gather notes in a single file and later
review it to make multiple notes out of it.  With the following
code, the user marks a region and then invokes the command
<code>my-denote-create-new-note-from-region</code>: it prompts for a title and
keywords and then uses the region's contents to fill in the newly
created note.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is not part of denote.el, though we provide it in the manual
for users that may need it.  Thanks to sundar bp for suggesting the
idea.  This was done via a private channel and the information is
shared with permission.
</p></li>

<li><p>
The manual has another entry titled "Split an Org subtree into its
own note", which is similar to the above idea of using the region's
contents but has some extra niceties provided by Org.  Quote:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
With Org files in particular, it is common to have nested headings which
could be split off into their own standalone notes.  In Org parlance an
entry with all its subheadings is a "subtree".  With the following code,
the user places the point inside the heading they want to split off and
invokes the command <code>my-denote-split-org-subtree</code>.  It will create a
note using the heading's text and tags for the new file.  The contents
of the subtree become the contents of the new note and are removed from
the old one.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thanks to Sven Seebeck for suggesting the idea and for testing my
prototypes.  This information is shared with permission, as it was
provided via a private channel.
</p></li>

<li>The manual describes how a user can leverage the built-in
<code>dired-virtual-mode</code> to perform arbitrary sorting of their list of
notes.  It also includes code for Eshell to quickly "export" a
command's output into a dedicated buffer (which can then be used to
derive a "virtual" Dired).  Thanks to Yi Liu for asking the question
that inspired this entry:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C1C75FF01-EC76-49DF-9AEB-ED718A2795FF@gmail.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C1C75FF01-EC76-49DF-9AEB-ED718A2795FF@gmail.com%3E</a>.</li>

<li>The <code>denote-faces-broken-link</code> has been removed.  It was used for
Org links.  The idea was to apply a different style if the link was
broken.  However, the way fontification works means that there may
be a performance penalty as Org tries to check again and again if
the link is broken or note.  As <code>denote:</code> links are robust (unless
the user tries to break them), this penalty is unacceptable.  Thanks
to Peter Prevos for reporting the issue and discussing it with me on
the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87k05umyyo.fsf%40prevos.net%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87k05umyyo.fsf%40prevos.net%3E</a>.</li>

<li>The "denote" group in Custom UI buffers now provides a link to the
Info manual that is shipped with the package.  To read the manual,
evaluate <code>(info "(denote) Top")</code>.  Else visit the official web page:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote</a>.</li>

<li>Fixed a case where an internal check for a note would throw an error
if the buffer was not visiting a file.  Thanks to Hilde Rhyne was
the patch: it is below the ~15 line threshold and thus does not
require copyright assignment to the Free Software Foundation.  The
issue was discussed on the mailing list and was pushed to users as
version <code>0.6.1</code>:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3Cm035d7nq22.fsf%40disroot.org%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3Cm035d7nq22.fsf%40disroot.org%3E</a>.</li>

<li>When linking to a file that has no front matter, Denote tries to use
the TITLE component of the file name (per our file-naming scheme) as
the link's descriptive text.  We now make this look a bit better, by
capitalising only the first letter while dehyphenating the text,
converting <code>this-is-a-test</code> to <code>This is a test</code>.  Before, we would
capitalise all words.  Thanks to Clemens Radermacher for the patch.
It was sent via a private channel.  Clemens has assigned copyright
to the Free Software Foundation.</li>

Lots of functions and variables which once were for "private" use (the
presence of double hyphens in the symbol) are now made public.
Concretely this means that they no longer have double hyphens in their
name and we pledge to support them henceforth.  "Support" means that
we (i) consider them stable, (ii) document them properly, (iii) will
record any changes made to them such as in a change log, a blog post
on my website, and via <code>make-obsolete</code>.
</p>

<p>
The manual provides a complete reference of what is on offer.  The
section is titled "For developers or advanced users":

<p>
Normally, we do not support private forms and can delete/modify them
without notice.  However, I decided to write obsoletion aliases for
all forms I made public or otherwise revised, in an effort not to
break any existing custom code.  The following table covers all
obsolete symbols and their new counterparts.  PLEASE UPDATE YOUR CODE
as those aliases will be removed in the near future.

<li>The Denote linking facility can now link to any file that has the
Denote file-naming scheme.  Before, we limited this feature to what we
consider "note" files, else the supported plain text formats (per
<code>denote-file-type</code>).  Thanks to Peter Prevos for the discussion on the
mailing list: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87fsi1m5ze.fsf%40prevos.net%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87fsi1m5ze.fsf%40prevos.net%3E</a>.</li>

<li>Date prompts may optionally use the familiar Org date-selection
mechanism that leverages the calendar.  This feature is subject to the
user option <code>denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date</code>.  A date prompt is
used by the <code>denote-date</code> command or, optionally, by the <code>denote</code>
command when the user option <code>denote-prompts</code> is configured
accordingly.  The manual elaborates on the specificities.  Thanks to

Leading empty spaces at the <code>denote</code> <code>TITLE</code> prompt no longer produce
hyphens: they are simply ignored to keep file names consistent.

<li>When linking to files that have no front matter, the link's anchor
text (the human-readable part) is derived from the file name <code>TITLE</code>
component.  We apply a de-hyphenation and capitalisation of its
constituent words.  This is not always perfect, but it is better than
something like <code>this-is-the-title</code>.  Thanks to Peter Prevos for the
original idea in pull request 93 at the GitHub mirror:

<li><p>
The active region is now used as the default value of the <code>denote</code>
command <code>TITLE</code> prompt.  The idea behind this Do-What-I-Mean-flavoured
patch is to be able to take a note about a subject that appears in a
buffer by simply marking it before invoking the <code>denote</code> command.

<li>The <code>denote-rename-file-using-front-matter</code> command now offers to save
the buffer if appropriate.  In the past, it would simply produce an
error asking the user to save the buffer.  Thanks to Peter Prevos for

The variable <code>denote-file-types</code> is an alist of plists which
substantiates the supported file types (per the user option
<code>denote-file-type</code>).  Properties pertain to the formatting of front
matter and the retrieval of relevant values.  The doc string of
<code>denote-file-types</code> explains the details, while the default value uses
the ancillary functions we define.  Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay

<p>
The general theme of this release is to refine what we already offer.
As I explained in some discussions, Denote is feature-complete.  We can
always improve the code or add some ancillary function/command/variable,
though all the main ideas have already been implemented.  Additional
functionality can be provided by other packages: I remain at the
disposal of anyone willing to write such a package.

The present release covers more than 150 commits since version 0.4.0 on

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:0878125f-8392-48e6-aeff-1469eb1e18fc">
<p>
We now provide the <code>denote-templates</code> user option.  A "template" is
arbitrary text that Denote will add to a newly created note right below
the front matter.
</p>

<p>
Templates are expressed as a <code>(KEY . STRING)</code> association.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <code>KEY</code> is the name which identifies the template.  It is an
arbitrary symbol, such as <code>report</code>, <code>memo</code>, <code>statement</code>.</li>

<li>The <code>STRING</code> is ordinary text that Denote will insert as-is.  It can
contain newline characters to add spacing.  The manual of Denote
contains examples on how to use the <code>concat</code> function, beside writing
a generic string:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:f635a490-d29e-4608-9372-7bd13b34d56c">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:f635a490-d29e-4608-9372-7bd13b34d56c</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The user can choose a template either by invoking the new command
<code>denote-template</code> or by changing the user option <code>denote-prompts</code> to
always prompt for a template when calling the <code>denote</code> command.
</p>

<p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:17688b79-cb1b-4a59-831e-fbf2a81245d3">
<p>
Denote used to format tags in Org files by separating them with two
spaces:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org2059a03">
#+filetags:  tag1  tag2
</pre>

<p>
While this worked for some obvious use-cases, it is not supported by
Org.  The Org documentation stipulates that tags be separated by the
colon sign.  The above would then be written thus:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org23fa1f1">
#+filetags:  :tag1:tag2:
</pre>

<p>
Denote now conforms with Org's specifications.  To help users update
their existing notes, we provide the <code>denote-migrate-old-org-filetags</code>
command.  It will perform the conversion in all Org files that had the
old notation.  As with all Denote operations that rewrite file contents,
it DOES NOT SAVE BUFFERS.  The user is expected to review the changes,
such as by using <code>diff-buffer-with-file</code>.  Multiple buffers can be saved
with <code>save-some-buffers</code> (check its doc string).
</p>

<p>
This command is provided for the convenience of the user.  It shall be
deprecated and eventually removed from future versions of Denote.
</p>

<p>
If you need help with any of this, please do not hesitate to contact me
either in private or in one of Denote's official channels (mailing list,
GitHub/GitLab mirror).
</p>

<p>
This is the same idea as above.  Before, we were making the mistake of
using incorrect YAML notation:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-yaml">tags:  tag1  tag2
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now we do:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-yaml">tags:  ["tag1", "tag2"]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is how the TOML variant always worked.

For the user's convenience, we provide a command to migrate from the old
to the new syntax: <code>denote-migrate-old-markdown-yaml-tags</code>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:15ecb4e8-d1ce-4e42-b74d-a3a046d93220">
<p>
Denote adds "front matter" to newly created notes which includes data
such as the title and keywords/tags of the document.  Strictly speaking,
the front matter is not required by Denote.  It is provided for the
user's convenience, such as for readability or if they want to use the
note with other programs (e.g. Org export, a blog with Hugo/Jekyll,
&#x2026;).
</p>

<p>
Denote provides commands which help the user rename their notes, by
changing the file name's <code>TITLE</code> and/or <code>KEYWORDS</code> components (per
Denote's file-naming scheme).  These commands also operate on the front
matter to keep the data between file name and file contents in sync
(again, for the user's convenience).
</p>

<p>
For this release we have consolidated and refined our offerings in order
to improve their ergonomics.  All changes are the result of fruitful
discussions on the mailing list and the issue tracker of the GitHub
mirror:

<p>
The commands <code>denote-dired-rename-file-and-add-front-matter</code> and
<code>denote-dired-rename-file</code> are deprecated and superseded by the new
<code>denote-rename-file</code>.  Please update any key bindings in your setup.
</p>

<p>
The difference between the old commands and the new <code>denote-rename-file</code>
is that the latter will now insert front matter to supported file types
(per <code>denote-file-type</code>) if they have none.  This basically means that,
e.g., renaming a generic Org/Markdown/Plain text file with
<code>denote-rename-file</code> will update its file name to comply with Denote's
file-naming scheme and also add the appropriate front matter (it
"converts" it to a Denote note).  If front matter exists, this command
will rewrite it to reflect the changes to the file name's <code>TITLE</code> and/or
<code>KEYWORDS</code>.
</p>

<p>
Consult the manual for the details:

</pre>
</div>

<p>
The user option <code>denote-dired-rename-expert</code> is obsolete.  Denote always
asks for confirmation when renaming a single file.  This is because the
user can rely on batch-renaming commands which ask for confirmation only
once per batch.

The command <code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files-and-add-front-matter</code> is
deprecated and its functionality is absorbed by the existing
<code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files</code> command.  The deprecated command was
used to insert front matter to supported file types (per
<code>denote-file-type</code>) that had none.  We now handle this internally, thus
streamlining the experience for the user.

<p>
Introduced the <code>denote-rename-file-using-front-matter</code> command.  This is
new functionality we provide which uses the front matter as input to
perform a rename of the file.  The aforementioned offerings prompt for
input via the minibuffer and propagate the changes firstly to the file
name and subsequently to the front matter.  Whereas with the command
<code>denote-rename-file-using-front-matter</code>, the user can edit the front
matter manually and then invoke the command to pass the changes to the
file name, subject to a confirmation.  Relevant entries are the title
and tags/filetags (depending on the file type).  The date and the
identifier are not pertinent.  Identifiers in file names are NEVER
rewritten by Denote.

We provide the <code>denote-faces-link</code> and the <code>denote-faces-broken-link</code>.
The latter is only relevant for Org, as Emacs' standard button mechanism
does not have a way to apply a face dynamically.

<p>
This is a change for themes/tinkerers who need to differentiate

<p>
The default value of the <code>denote-directory</code> user option used to be
<code>~/Documents/notes</code> (subject to some conversion via Elisp).  Denote now
conforms with the freedesktop.org specifications by using the <code>XDG</code>
directory for <code>DOCUMENTS</code> instead of <code>~/Documents</code>:
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs/">https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs/</a>.
</p>

<p>
Users who already bind the <code>denote-directory</code> are not affected by this
change.  Same for those who do not tinker with <code>XDG</code> environment
variables and/or do not use some exotic setup.

The backlinks' buffer now uses the <code>denote-backlink-mode</code> instead of the
generic <code>special-mode</code>.  The former derives from the latter.  It binds
keys to move between links with <code>n</code> (next) and <code>p</code> (previous).  These
are stored in the <code>denote-backlink-mode-map</code> (use <code>M-x describe-mode</code>
(<code>C-h m</code>) in an unfamiliar buffer to learn more about it).

All Denote code is consolidated in <code>denote.el</code>.  We no longer maintain
separate files like <code>denote-link.el</code>, <code>denote-dired.el</code>, etc.  Users
who had <code>require</code> calls to such libraries must remove them and only
keep:

<div class="org-src-container">

User options that have an entry in the manual will now provide a link
to it via their Help buffer and/or the Custom UI.  This is done by
adding the <code>:link</code> attribute to their declaration.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, user options and faces now specify the version of Denote
that last affected their value (e.g. <code>denote-directory</code>, which was
mentioned above for the XDG spec, now informs the user that it changed
for version <code>0.5.0</code>).
</p>

<p>
[ I learnt these by developing the <code>modus-themes</code>. ]
</p></li>

<li>The variables <code>denote-last-title</code>, <code>denote-last-keywords</code>,
<code>denote-last-buffer</code>, and <code>denote-last-front-matter</code> are all obsolete.
These were used prior to version <code>0.1.0</code> to help with development but
are now deemed surplus to requirements.</li>

<li>Lots of changes were made to private functions, variables, doc
strings, and comments, in the interest of simplifying the code and/or
ensuring consistency in how operations are carried out.  Though
everything is the same for the end-user.</li>

Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the numerous contributions on the

need to know what is happening internally (consult the Git log for the

Paul van Gelder asked about this on the mailing list.  I provided
guidelines on what can be done, though did not record anything in the
manual: I prefer to elicit more feedback from users.  The gist is that
Emacs already has all the requisite functionality, though encryption per
se is outside the scope of Denote:

Hilde Rhyne shared a workaround they have to disable <code>diredfl-mode</code> in
the buffers where <code>denote-dired-mode</code> is enabled.  The conflict between
the two is a known issue that is acknowledged in the manual:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3Cm0tu6q6bg0.fsf%40disroot.org%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3Cm0tu6q6bg0.fsf%40disroot.org%3E</a>.

<p>
I think we need a proper solution in the code we provide, so this
workaround is not mentioned in the manual.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-h:068108f4-a4fa-4ff8-be49-f1f10a862451">
<p>
There was a discussion started by Fourchaux, with the participation of
basaran and Andre0991 on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/71">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/71</a>.
</p>

<p>
The gist of my answer is that Denote does not need to provide such a
facility because notes are ordinary files: whatever the user already has
for them should apply to Denote.  If the user has nothing to search
through files, they anyhow need something that works outside the
confines of Denote: a <code>denote-SEARCH</code> command is not an adequate
solution.
</p>

<p>
Emacs has numerous built-in commands, such as <code>grep</code> (<code>lgrep</code> and
<code>rgrep</code>), <code>project-find-regexp</code>, <code>find-grep-dired</code>, <code>ibuffer-do-occur</code>,
&#x2026;  Furthermore, there are lots of high quality packages that have
their own wrappers or extensions for searching file contents, such as
the <code>ivy</code> and <code>helm</code> completion frameworks, as well as <code>consult</code> (the
commands <code>consult-grep</code> and <code>consult-ripgrep</code>), <code>consult-notes</code>, <code>rg</code>,
<code>deadgrep</code>, <code>deft</code>, and probably plenty more that do not come to mind
right now.
</p>

<p>
I strongly encourage the user to find a universal search solution to the
problem of searching file contents.

<li><p>
Defined the <code>denote-link-dired-marked-notes</code> command.  It lets the
user produce a typographic list of links to the note files that are
marked in Dired.  The list is written at point.  If there are multiple
buffers which visit Denote notes, the command first prompts with
minibuffer completion for one among them.
</p>

<p>
In terms of workflow, <code>denote-link-dired-marked-notes</code> complements the
<code>denote-link-add-links</code> command for those cases where it is easier to
select files than write an elegant regular expression.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Implemented the <code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files</code> command.  This
provides a much-requested facility to perform the familiar renaming
operation on a set of files.  In particular:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the file's existing file name is retained and becomes the <code>TITLE</code>
field, per Denote's file-naming scheme;</li>

<li>the <code>TITLE</code> is sluggified and downcased, per our conventions;</li>

<li>an identifier is prepended to the <code>TITLE</code>;</li>

<li>the file's extension is retained;</li>

<li>a prompt is asked once for the <code>KEYWORDS</code> field and the input is
applied to all file names;</li>

<li>if the file is recognised as a Denote note, the command rewrites its
front matter to include the new keywords.  A confirmation to carry
out this step is performed once at the outset.  Note that the
affected buffers are not saved.  The user can thus check them to
confirm that the new front matter does not cause any problems
(e.g. with the command <code>diff-buffer-with-file</code>).  Multiple buffers
can be saved with <code>save-some-buffers</code> (read its doc string).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Parts of <code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files</code> were added or refined over
a series of commits.  Consult the Git log for the minutia.  Thanks to
Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the relevant additions in pull requests
51 and 52 on the GitHub mirror:

</p></li>

<li>Improved how the <code>denote-dired-rename-file</code> command rewrites front
matter.  Before, it would perform a replacement of the whole block,
which had the adverse effect of overwriting custom front matter
entries.  Now, it only targets the lines which hold the title and
keywords, leaving everything else intact.  Thanks to Peter Prevos for
reporting the problem and testing the solution to it in issue 60 on
the GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/60">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/60</a>.</li>

<li><p>
Introduced the <code>denote-dired-rename-file-and-add-front-matter</code> command
that always prepends front matter to a file whose extension is among
the supported ones (per the user option <code>denote-file-type</code>).  This
differs from the standard <code>denote-dired-rename-file</code> command which
only rewrites the front matter's title and keywords if they exist.
</p>

<p>
In practice, <code>denote-dired-rename-file-and-add-front-matter</code> empowers
the user to convert a generic text file to a Denote note.
</p>

<p>
This command was originally added by Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay in pull
request 49 on the GitHub mirror and refined in subsequent commits:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/49">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/49</a>.  Also read issue 48
where this idea was originally discussed:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/48">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/48</a>.
</p></li>

<li>Added the <code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files-and-add-front-matters</code>
command, which is like the <code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files</code> but adds
front matter instead of rewriting existing one, just how the command
<code>denote-dired-rename-file-and-add-front-matter</code> does it (both are
mentioned above).  Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the
refinements to it in pull request 53 on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/53">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/53</a>.</li>

<li>Wrote an interactive spec for <code>denote-link-buttonize-buffer</code>.  It can
now be invoked with <code>M-x</code> or a key binding, should the need arise.
This function is normally called via a hook and takes effect in plain
text as well as Markdown files.</li>

<li><p>
Extended the fontification rules so that file names with non-ASCII
characters are styled properly.  This issue was brought up on the
mailing list by Frank Ehmsen and was discussed with the participation
of Peter Prevos:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C2273b3b1-344c-6c6e-3ab6-a227b6bc3721%40eh-is.de%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C2273b3b1-344c-6c6e-3ab6-a227b6bc3721%40eh-is.de%3E</a>.

The same topic was raised at the same time on the GitHub mirror by
user hpgisler in issue 61:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/61">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/61</a>.
</p>

<p>
After some discussion, we agreed on the right approach, which was
formalised by Peter Prevos as pull request 64 on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/64">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/64</a>.  The change is below
the ~15 line threshold and thus does not require copyright assignment
to the Free Software Foundation.
</p></li>

<li>Made the registration of the <code>denote:</code> custom Org hyperlink type
conditional on the availability of the <code>org</code> feature.  In other words,
those who do not use Org will not be loading this part of the code.
Thanks to Abin Simon for reporting the problem and for showing how
Elfeed handles this case.  This was done in issue 47 on the GitHub
mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/47">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/47</a>.</li>

<li>Ensured that duplicate keywords are not produced by the relevant
prompt.  Thanks to user Taoufik for the contribution in pull request
50 on the GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/50">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/50</a>.
The change is below the ~15 line threshold and thus does not require
copyright assignment to the Free Software Foundation.</li>

<li>Fixed a typo in the reference to the <code>crm-separator</code> in the manual.
David Wilson (System Crafters channel) spotted the error in a recent
live stream whose main topic was about Denote (thanks, by the way!):
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcRY_rsX0yY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcRY_rsX0yY</a>.</li>

<li>Addressed an inconsistency in the command <code>denote-link-find-file</code>
where it would not recognise links without a title in their format
(those can be inserted by passing a prefix argument (<code>C-u</code> by default)
to the commands that insert links, such as <code>denote-link</code>).</li>

<li>Attached conditionality to the <code>denote</code> command's <code>SUBDIRECTORY</code>
argument, so that it does not create new file paths.  This is only
relevant for those who call <code>denote</code> from Lisp.  Interactive use is
the same as before.</li>

<li>Clarified that the user option <code>denote-org-capture-specifiers</code> can
accept arbitrary text in addition to the formatting specifiers that
Org's capture mechanism introduces.</li>

<li>Explained in the manual why <code>denote-org-capture-specifiers</code> is needed
instead of writing the capture template directly the way one normally
does.  The gist is that because our file names are derived dynamically
based on user input, we need to account for the sequence in which the
value of arguments is reified by <code>org-capture</code>.</li>

<li>Refactored how notes are prepared internally.  Thanks to Jean-Philippe
Gagné Guay for the contribution in pull request 55 on the GitHub
mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/55">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/55</a>.</li>

<li><p>
Declared the <code>denote-punctuation-excluded-extra-regexp</code> variable which
is, for the time being, targeted at experienced users.  Its purpose is
to extend what we consider "illegal" punctuation for the file name.
Thanks to pRot0ta1p for the feedback in issue 57 over at the GitHub
mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/57">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/57</a>.  Example
based on the input of pRot0ta1p:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">setq</span> denote-punctuation-excluded-extra-regexp
      <span class="org-string">"[&#12302;&#12303;&#12310;&#12311;&#65371;&#65373;&#12300;&#12301;&#12304;&#12305;&#12308;&#12309;&#65339;&#65341;&#65288;&#65289;&#12298;&#12299;&#12296;&#12297;&#171;&#187;&#65281;&#65283;&#65509;&#65285;&#8230;&#65286;&#65282;&#65287;&#65290;&#65292;&#12290;&#65307;&#65306;&#12289;&#65311;&#8212;]*"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The ideal is to make <code>denote--punctuation-regexp</code> work for all
scripts, but that may be unrealistic.
</p></li>

<li>Clarified what the manual means by "attachments" to notes.  Those are
for Org, if the user resorts to the relevant Org mechanisms.  Denote
does not do any of that.</li>

<li><p>
Revised the parsing of a date input as used in the <code>denote-date</code>
command or related.  The idea is to turn <code>2020-01-15</code> into something
like <code>2020-01-15 16:19</code> by using the current time, so that the hour
and minute component is not left to <code>00:00</code> when the user does not
specify it explicitly.
</p>

<p>
This reduces the burden on the user who would otherwise need to input
the time value in order to avoid the error of duplicate identifiers in
the scenario where the same date is used more than once.
</p>

<p>
The change also addresses a difference between Emacs 28 and Emacs 29
where the former does not read dates without a time component.
</p>

mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/58">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/58</a>.

<li>Fixed compilation warnings in Emacs 29 about the format of doc strings
that need to output a literal single quote.  Thanks to Kyle Meyer for
the patch, which was sent on the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/34117">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/34117</a>.</li>

<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/34116">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/34116</a>.</li>

<li>Made the built-in <code>subr-x</code> library a runtime dependency, due to
complications with the <code>when-let*</code> form.  The problem was made
manifest in a renaming operation, though it was not about renaming per
se.  Thanks to hpgisler for reporting the problem in issue 62 and for
testing the proposed solution:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/62">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/62</a>.</li>

<li>Streamlined the use of the <code>seq</code> library instead of <code>cl-lib</code>, as we
were already using the former more heavily and there was no need for
the latter.  Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for pointing this out on the
emacs-devel mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-07/msg00838.html">https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-07/msg00838.html</a>.</li>

<li>Added a generic <code>README.md</code> file to placate the Git forges.  Neither
SourceHut nor GitHub/GitLab are fully compliant with the Org markup we
use in <code>README.org</code> (we use Org because it is easy to generate the
Info manual and HTML pages out of it).  SourceHut will not render the
file at all, while the others render it but do not parse it properly.</li>

<li>Made several other internal tweaks and refinements in the interest of
robustness and/or clarity.</li>

<li>Rewrote all relevant documentation.</li>

The following are not part of any changes that were made during this
release cycle, though they provide potentially interesting insight into
the workings of the project.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Identifiers with milliseconds</dt><dd>Denote's identifier format extends up
to seconds.  This is the product of years of experimentation and is,
in my opinion, the best compromise between usability/readability and
precision.  If a user produces two notes within a fraction of a
second, then yes they will have duplicate identifiers.  In principle,
there is no reason not to address this potential problem, provided we
do not compromise on Denote's file-naming scheme (making the
identifier less readable is a compromise).  We shall see what the best
course of action is.  Thanks to Felipe Balbi and Jean-Philippe Gagné
Guay for the discussion thus far in issue 54 on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/54">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/54</a>.</dd>

<dt>Denote and evil-mode</dt><dd>Users of evil-mode do not have to worry about
Denote, as we do not define any key bindings.  The manual includes
sample configuration, which proposes some key bindings, but that is
the user's prerogative.  Thanks to Saša Janiška and Alan Schmitt for
their participation on the mailing list:

<dt>Denote and Citar</dt><dd>Peter Prevos started developing a package that
connects Denote with Citar: <a href="https://github.com/pprevos/denote-citar">https://github.com/pprevos/denote-citar</a>.
The idea is to use notes as part of one's bibliography.  Discussions
which include sample code on how to leverage <code>denote</code> from Lisp:

</ul></dd>

<dt>Denote and graph of connections</dt><dd>Saša Janiška asked whether Denote
will provide some way to visualise links between notes.  The answer is
negative.  Denote's scope is clearly delineated and its feature set is
largely complete (notwithstanding refinements to what we already
provide).  Peter Prevos is experimenting with some code that uses the
R language.  Any such facility will have to be implemented as a
separate package.  I remain at the disposal of anyone who needs help
with Denote's internals.  Thanks to the aforementioned fellows for
their participation on the mailing list:

<dt>Denote's scalability</dt><dd>There was a discussion whether Denote will
work well with very large sets of files.  The short answer is that it
will work the same way Emacs and/or standard Unix tools do: good
enough!  If there are improvements to be made, which do not jeopardise
the principles of the project, we shall implement them without
hesitation.  Thanks to Saša Janiška and Peter Prevos for their
participation on the mailing list:

<dt>Denote's minimum requirement of Emacs 27.2</dt><dd><p>
We cannot depend on
Emacs 27.1 due to this message from the byte compiler:
</p>

<pre class="example">
You should depend on (emacs "27.2") or the (org "9.3") package if you need `org-link-open-as-file'.
</pre>


<p>
Depending on Org is not an option because Denote optionally works
without Org, so Emacs 27.2 is what we have to opt for.  If your
operating system does not provide this version in package format,
please petition its maintainers/providers to do so.  Thanks to
Alexander for asking about it on the mailing list:

Finally, a mildly interesting piece of trivia: we have exceeded 600
commits since the first day of the project's Git history on 2022-06-04
(the actual history is much longer).  That averages to more than 10 per
day!  I think things will slow down eventually.

Fixed how references are analysed to produce the backlinks' buffer.
This should resolve the issue that some users faced where the
backlinks would not be produced.
</p>

<p>
The previous implementation would not yield the appropriate results if
(i) the value of the user option <code>denote-directory</code> was a "project"
per the built-in project.el and (ii) the link to the given entry was
from a subdirectory.  In short, the references were sometimes returned
as relative file paths, whereas they should always be absolute.

Addressed a regression in the function <code>denote-directory</code> (this is the
function that normalises the variable of the same name) which
prevented it from returning an expanded file path.  This too
contributed to problems with the backlinking facility.  Thanks to

Introduced the user option <code>denote-prompts</code> (read its doc string or
the relevant entry in the manual).  It governs how the standard
<code>denote</code> command for creating new notes will behave in interactive
usage.  By default, <code>denote</code> prompts for a title and keywords.  With
<code>denote-prompts</code>, the command can also ask for a file type (per
<code>denote-file-type</code>), subdirectory of the <code>denote-directory</code>, and a
specific date+time.  Prompts occur in the order they are specified.
Furthermore, the <code>denote-prompts</code> can be set to values which do not
include the title and keywords.  This means that the resulting file
names can be any of those permutations:
</p>

<pre class="example">
DATE.EXT
DATE--TITLE.EXT
DATE__KEYWORDS.EXT
</pre>


<p>
Recall that Denote's standard file-naming scheme is defined as follows
(read the manual for the details):
</p>

<pre class="example">
DATE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXT
</pre>


<p>
For our purposes, Denote will work perfectly fine for linking and
backlinking, even if file names do not include the <code>TITLE</code> and
<code>KEYWORDS</code> fields.  However, the user is advised to consider the
implications on usability: notes without a descriptive title and/or
useful keywords may be hard to filter and practically impossible to
manage at scale.  File names without such information should at least
be added to subdirectories which themselves have a descriptive name.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, Denote does not have strong opinions about one's
workflow.  The standard file name is the culmination of years of
experience.
</p>

<p>
Consider the <code>denote-prompts</code> the affirmative answer to the question
"Can keywords be optional?" as posed by Jack Baty on the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C8D392BC3-980A-4E5B-9480-D6A00BE8279F%40baty.net%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C8D392BC3-980A-4E5B-9480-D6A00BE8279F%40baty.net%3E</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the original contribution in
commit 9b981a2.  It was originally part of a pull request, but due to
some internal changes I had to merge it as a patch and technically the
web UI did not count the PR as "merged" (though it was in terms of
substance).
</p></li>

<li><p>
Refactored the <code>denote</code> command to (i) accommodate the new user option
<code>denote-prompts</code> via its interactive specification and (ii) be more
flexible when called from Lisp.  The latter scenario is for advanced
users or, generally, those who can maintain some custom code in their
configuration.  A case in point is one of the examples we show in the
manual for a programmatic way to create notes that automatically get
the <code>journal</code> tag:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">my-denote-journal</span> ()
  <span class="org-doc">"Create an entry tagged '</span><span class="org-doc"><span class="org-constant">journal</span></span><span class="org-doc">', while prompting for a title."</span>
  (<span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
  (denote
   (denote--title-prompt)
   '(<span class="org-string">"journal"</span>)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Notice that the <code>'("journal")</code> is a list of strings even for a single
keyword.  Whereas before a single one was a plain string.  This is a
breaking change.
</p>

<p>
Please consult the doc string of the <code>denote</code> command for the
technicalities.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Refashioned the interactive convenience functions of <code>denote-type</code>,
<code>denote-date</code>, <code>denote-subdirectory</code> to leverage the <code>denote-prompts</code>
user option while calling <code>denote</code> interactively.  In practical terms,
they no longer accept any arguments when called from Lisp.  Users who
need a programmatic approach are advised to either call <code>denote</code>
directly, or check how these commands <code>let</code> bind the <code>denote-prompts</code>
to carry out their operations.  The doc string of each command
explains how it works.  Or evaluate this to check the manual:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(info <span class="org-string">"(denote) Convenience commands for note creation"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

</p></li>

<li><p>
Documented how the user option <code>denote-directory</code> can accept a local
value.  This is pertinent to scenaria where the user needs to maintain
separate directories of notes.  By "separate" we mean sets of notes
that do not communicate with each other, cannot create links between
them, etc.  The manual delves into the technicalities.  If you have
the Info entry installed, evaluate:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<li>Added an entry to the manual's Frequently Asked Questions about a
failed search for backlinks.  It includes sample code that users of
Windows can apply, if necessary.  (The error is not Denote's fault.)
Thanks to Benjamin Kästner for the patch, which is below the ~15 line
threshold and thus does not require copyright assignment to the Free
Software Foundation:

<li>Removed duplicate entries from the list of file paths that the <code>xref</code>
library returns for the purposes of backlinking.  Thanks to
Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the contribution in pull request 44 on
the GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/44">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/44</a>.</li>

<li>Applied an appropriate face to the backlinks' button to mitigate an
error.  Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the contribution in
pull request 45 on the GitHub mirror and for later testing a
subsequent tweak: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/45">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/45</a>.</li>

<li>Simplfied all the faces we define to make them work with all themes.
The previous colours were consistent with the <code>modus-themes</code>:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes</a>.</li>

<li>Refined how strings are sluggified under all circumstances.  Before, a
nil value for the user option <code>denote-allow-multi-word-keywords</code> would
have the adverse effect of joining all the strings in the title field
of the file name.  The intent always was to do that only for
multi-word keywords, not the title.  This change was part of a hotfix,
formalised as version <code>0.2.1</code> a day after the release of <code>0.2.0</code>.</li>

<li>Made the fontification rules more robust, while avoiding any false
positives.  This was done over a series of commits as it had
implications for the file name permutations that were mentioned
earlier.  Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the patches and/or
discussion about the merits of each change and concomitant
considerations:

bulk.  It might happen at some point, though it is no mean task.

<li>Version <code>0.1.0</code> (from 2022-06-27) was never built as a package.  The
reason is that the GNU ELPA machinery reads the <code>Version:</code> header of
the main file, not the git tag.  As the original commit in <code>denote.el</code>
included <code>Version: 0.1.0</code>, GNU ELPA rightly tries to build the package
using that reference.  But because at that time I had not yet updated
the Copyright header to name the Free Software Foundation, the package
could not be prepared.  As such, please consider this release to be
the "first formal stable version".  My apologies for the delay,

<li>Originally, Denote was designed to only work with notes in a flat
directory.  With code contributions from Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay,
support for subdirectories of the user option <code>denote-directory</code> is
now available.  This covers the case of creating links between notes,
following them, and viewing the backlinks' buffer of the current
entry.

<li>From 2022-06-24 to 2022-07-03, Denote provided support for links
between Org notes that leveraged the <code>id:</code> hyperlink type.
Discussions on the mailing list and the GitHub mirror revealed the
longer-term problems in our implementation.  In the Annex below, I
provide my detailed opinion on the matter.  The gist is that Denote
does not&#x2014;and will not&#x2014;create <code>id:</code> links between its notes, but
shall use the <code>denote:</code> hyperlink type instead (which works like the
standard <code>file:</code> type).  As the Annex explains, Denote is not org-roam
lite and we try not to engender such false expectations.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Despite the fact that the relevant patches are no longer applicable,
I wish to thank Kaushal Modi and Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for their

</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>
The user option <code>denote-date-format</code> controls how the date and time is
recorded in the file's contents (what we call "front matter").  When
nil (the default value), we use a file-type-specific format (also
check the user option <code>denote-file-type</code>):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For Org, an inactive timestamp is used, such as <code>[2022-06-30 Wed 15:31]</code>.</li>

<li>For Markdown, the RFC3339 standard is applied: <code>2022-06-30T15:48:00+03:00</code>.</li>

<li>For plain text, the format is that of ISO 8601: <code>2022-06-30</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the value is a string, ignore the above and use it instead.  The
string must include format specifiers for the date.  These are described
in the doc string of <code>format-time-string</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-date-format</code> supersedes the now obsolete
<code>denote-front-matter-date-format</code>.

</p></li>

<li>All the faces we define are now declared in the <code>denote-faces.el</code>
file.  The fontification rules are shared by <code>denote-dired-mode</code> and
the backlinks' buffer (invoked by <code>denote-link-backlinks</code> and
controlled by the user option <code>denote-link-fontify-backlinks</code>).  The
current list of faces:

<ul class="org-ul">

<li><code>denote-faces-time</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-title</code></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Named the mailing list address as the <code>Maintainer:</code> of Denote.
Together with the other package headers, they help the user find our
primary sources and/or communication channels.  This change conforms
with work being done upstream in package.el by Philip Kaludercic.  I
was informed about it here:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/%3C875ykl84yi.fsf%40posteo.net%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/%3C875ykl84yi.fsf%40posteo.net%3E</a>.</li>

<li>Fixed how keywords are inferred and combined.  The previous code did not
work properly when the user option <code>denote-infer-keywords</code> was nil.
It would return a list of symbols, with the parentheses, whereas the
file name needs a string where each keyword is delimited by an
underscore.</li>

<li>Simplified how information in the front matter is retrieved.  It fixes
cases where, for example, a special character at the end of the title
was ignored.  Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the patch over at

    REMOVE support for 'id:' hyperlink types

    The original idea was to support the 'org-id' library on the premise
    that it makes Denote a good Emacs citizen.  However, discussions on the
    mailing list[0] and the GitHub mirror[1] have made it clear to me that
    'org-id' is not consistent with Denote's emphasis on simplicity.

    To support the way 'org-id' works, we will eventually have to develop
    some caching mechanism, just how the org-roam package does it.  This is
    because the variable 'org-id-extra-files' needs to be kept up-to-date
    whenever an operation on a file is performed.  At scale, this sort of
    monitoring requires specialised software.  Such a mechanism is outside
    the scope of Denote---if you need a db, use org-roam which is already
    great.

    [0] &lt;https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C8735fk4y1w.fsf%40hallac.net%3E#%3C877d4un73c.fsf@protesilaos.com%3E&gt;

    [1] &lt;https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/29&gt;

    Quote of what I wrote on the GitHub mirror issue 29:

            [ggjp] This is what I was implying.  That we are, in fact,
            providing an option that is not viable long-term, but keeping
            the option for expert users who will be able to handle this.
            And we should warn about this clearly in the doc of that option.

        [protesilaos] What you write here @ggjp and what @shrysr explained
        tells me that those expert users will need to be real experts.  To
        put it concretely, I am an experienced Emacs user with no
        programming background, who has written several Emacs
        packages (including the modus-themes which are built into Emacs),
        but I have zero knowledge of using a db or of handling things with
        python and the like.  So if I opt in to 'denote-link-use-org-id' I
        will eventually run into problems that my non-existent skills will
        prevent me from solving.  At that point, I will just use org-roam
        which already handles this use-case in a competent way (and has a
        massive community to rely on in case I need further support).

        If each package needs to write its own optimisations and maintain
        its own cache, to me this shows that 'org-id' is not good enough for
        the time being: more work needs to be done in org.git to provide a
        universal solution.

        I wanted to support 'org-id' by default on the premise that Denote
        must be a good Emacs citizen which interoperates with the rest of
        the wider ecosystem.  But if 'org-id' leaves something to be
        desired, then that goal is not worth pursuing: we add complexity to
        our code, offer an option that we cannot genuinely/adequately
        support, and make usage of it contingent on reading the docs and
        having a high level of expertise.

        I think being a good Emacs citizen is a laudable principle.  In this
        case, the right thing to do is to recommend the use of org-roam
        instead of trying to accommodate 'org-id'.  As such, I have now
        changed my mind and think we should remove what we previously added.

        For some context here: the reason I never used org-roam is
        because (i) it is Org-specific whereas I write notes in different
        file types and (ii) I did not want to ever rely on a db or
        equivalent dependency.

Followed up by my explanation:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">&gt; can we not have denote style links to be default for (de)notes - and
&gt; explicitly supported, while if they need to, users can still link
&gt; denote org files via org-id to any other notes/files (and vice versa)
&gt; -- in which case performance + testing for org-id driven linking is
&gt; not within Denote's purview at all?

The formal support for `id:` links was added shortly before the release
of version `0.1.0`.  In the days prior, we supported what you describe
via the manual.  The user could change the `denote-org-front-matter`
variable to include a `PROPERTIES` drawer.  This possibility still
exists, though yesterday I removed the relevant entry from the manual.
This way only the real do-it-yourself experts will go down that path.

My concern here is with managing expectations.  If our Org notes are
superficially the same as org-roam's, an unsuspecting user may think
that Denote is an org-roam lite.  We will thus get issues/requests, such
as those already mentioned in this GitHub repo, about migrating from
org-roam to Denote.  While there are similarities, Denote is not a
minimalist org-roam and I would not like to encourage the idea of
treating the two as interchangeable.

Doing things half-way-through is a way to create false expectations.  A
package on GNU ELPA must be usable by users of all skill levels.  If the
functionality we provide is incomplete and needs to be covered by
user-level tweaks, we are excluding a portion of the user base while
still assuming the maintenance burden.  If someone trusts Denote to,
say, write a 1000 notes, we do not want to surprise them after the fact.
Imagine if the reported issues that triggered this change happened 6
months into one's daily usage of Denote: it wouldn't be nice.

Setting the right expectations is a matter of responsibility: we let the
user make a more informed choice and show respect for their time.  It
also makes it easier for me to keep Denote's scope in check by not
supporting every little extra that Org implements.  The premier Org
extension is org-roam: we do not need another one (or, if we do, I am
not the one to implement it).

Some comments on the `denote:` hyperlink type for Org as they may be
relevant in this context:

* It is meant to work like the standard `file:` type.  This means that
  it links to a file, while it can also have additional search
  parameters, as explained in the Org manual.  Evaluate:

      (info "(org) Search Options")

* It does not read the front matter, but only the file name.  You can
  create a note as usual, delete all its contents, save it, and try to
  link to it from another note.  It works.

* Exporting now works like the `file:` type for HTML, LaTeX, Texinfo,
  and Markdown.  Technically, it also supports the ASCII backend but the
  format of the output could be tweaked further.

There may be refinements to be made, which is okay as that is part of a
maintainer's duties.

The front matter of notes in Org has changed to be compliant with the
standard <code>org-id</code> infrastructure.  A <code>PROPERTIES</code> drawer is added to
the top of the file, which includes an <code>ID</code> property with the value of
the Denote identifier.  Sample:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org"><span class="org-org-drawer">:PROPERTIES:</span>
<span class="org-org-special-keyword">:ID:</span>          <span class="org-org-property-value">20220610T202537</span>
<span class="org-org-drawer">:END:</span>
<span class="org-org-document-info-keyword">#+title:</span>      <span class="org-org-document-title">Sample Org front matter
</span><span class="org-org-document-info-keyword">#+date:</span>       <span class="org-org-document-info">2022-06-10
</span><span class="org-org-meta-line">#+filetags:   denote  testing</span>
</pre>
</div></li>

<li><p>
The front matter of Markdown (YAML or TOML) and plain text files
remains constant.  For completeness, this is how they look:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-md">---
title:      "Sample with Markdown and YAML"
date:       2022-06-10
tags:       denote  testing
identifier: "20220610T202021"
---
</pre>
</div>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-md">+++
title      = "Sample with Markdown and TOML"
date       = 2022-06-10
tags       = ["denote", "testing"]
identifier = "20220610T201510"
+++
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example" id="org6750707">
title:      Sample plain text
date:       2022-06-10
tags:       denote  testing

<li>The integration with <code>org-id</code> extends to how linking works.  By
default, Denote uses its own custom hyperlink type which starts with
the <code>denote:</code> prefix.  In Org, it works like the <code>file:</code> type.  When
the user option <code>denote-link-use-org-id</code> is non-nil, links from Org
notes to other Org notes will use the standard <code>id:</code> type instead.  As
this is an Org-specific feature, Denote takes care to use the
major-mode-agnostic <code>denote:</code> type when the link targets a non-Org
note.</li>

<li><p>
In Org files the links created by Denote are buttonized automatically.
For Markdown and plain text, we use our own methods.  When a link is
inserted it is buttonized outright.  To buttonize links in existing
notes while visiting them in a buffer, add/evaluate this (it excludes
Org on its own):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(add-hook 'find-file-hook #'denote-link-buttonize-buffer)
</pre>
</div></li>

<li>The generation of the backlinks' buffer now uses the built-in <code>xref</code>
library instead of relying on a hardcoded call to the <code>find</code>
executable.  This means that the <code>denote-link-backlinks</code> command will,
in principle, work properly with all Emacs builds.</li>

<li>Users of Emacs 28 or higher can configure <code>xref-search-program</code> to
change from the default <code>grep</code> to <code>ripgrep</code>, <code>ugrep</code>, or a
user-defined alternative.</li>

<li>This is the first stable release of Denote.  It covers close to 400
commits starting from 2022-06-04.  Denote is the successor to a toy
package of mine, USLS, whose first public version was made available
in early November 2020: <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/usls">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/usls</a>.</li>

<li>Thanks to everyone involved in the development of Denote.  Code
contributions, bug reports, discussion of ideas, are all valuable.
